					What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? 
					I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, 
					and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and 
					I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare 
					and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are 
					nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck 
					out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before 
					on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away 
					with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. 
					As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the 
					USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare 
					for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic 
					little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can 
					be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred 
					ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively 
					trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal 
					of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full 
					extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, 
					you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy 
					retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down 
					upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you 
					couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn 
					idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. 
					You're fucking dead, kiddo.
